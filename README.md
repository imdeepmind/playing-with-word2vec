# Playing with Word2Vec
A simple python app for understanding the power of word2vec.

In this project, I trained a word2vec model on live twitter data. Then build a resp API then accepts a word and tells the most similar words. This project is best for understanding the power of word2vec model. For this project, I've used `gensim`.

For building the front-end part I've used bootstrap 4.
